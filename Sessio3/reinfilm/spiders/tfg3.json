{"genre": "Thriller Mystery", "depth": 2, "year": "1931", "synopsis": "In Fritz Langs startling and exquisite film M, fear stalks the streets of Berlin in the form of a serial child murderer whose grisly accomplishments are so heinous even the criminal minds of the underworld want him dead. Filmed in post-Weimar Germany during the infancy of the Nazi state, this tale of moral depravity serves not just as an allegory for the need of justice for all, but as an ominous foreshadowing of the sort of societal hysteria that leads to cultural witch hunts. Originally titled \"M\u00f6rder Unter Uns\" (\"Murder Among Us\"), M was one of Peter Lorre's (CASABLANCA) first major film roles. Langs expressionistic eye plunges into the dark cityscape of Berlin, as he follows the killer whistling down the street, seducing small children with toys and candy, and eventually fleeing for his life. A city paralysed by fear, and a vast criminal underground network of blind beggars, thieves and murderers, as well as an unforgettable climax notable for its startling statement about the murderous nature which resides within human beings, are all rendered in Lang\u2019s painterly cinematography of sharp angles, dark corners and breakneck pacing.", "cast": "Peter Lorre Otto Wernicke Gustav Gr\u00fcndgens Theo Lingen Theodor Loos Georg John Ellen Widman Inge Landgut", "url": "https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film875960.html", "download_timeout": 180.0, "duration": "111 min.", "director": "Fritz Lang", "download_latency": 1.0009784698486328, "download_slot": "www.filmaffinity.com", "mark": "8.3", "country": "Germany", "title": "M "},

The people are coming from everywhere. From the neighbouring settlings, from different holes of the Plain, even from quite far away parts of the country. They are following this clumsy monster as a dumb, faceless, rag-wearing crowd. This strange state of affairs - the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost - disturbs the order of the small town.

The tension growing to the unbearable is brought to explosion by the figure of the Prince, who is pretending facelessness and is lying low behind the whale. Even his mere appearance is enough to break loose the destroying emotions. The apocalypse that sweeps away everything spares nothing.

At first he wilts under the rigorous conditions of jungle life, freezes up in a fire fight, and wonders whether he'll be able to survive. But he gradually adapts and, as time goes by, begins to see that the platoon is divided into two groups. One consists of lifers, juicers, and subintelligent whites, the other of blacks and heads. Sgt. Barnes, a combat-loving burnout (Tom Berenger), is the informal leader of the lifers, and Sgt. Elias, a free spirit (Willem Dafoe), leads the latter group. When the platoon takes some gruesome losses, an enraged Barnes kills some Vietnamese and orders the burning of their village, outraging the temporarily absent Elias. As the conflict between these two reaches its tragic climax, Chris must decide what he really values. Widely regarded as one of the finest war films ever made, PLATOON reflects not only the United States' division over Vietnam but the timeless truths of battle: terror, disorientation, exhilaration, and horrible loss.", "cast": "Charlie Sheen Tom Berenger Willem Dafoe Kevin Dillon Forest Whitaker Johnny Depp John C.

{"genre": "Drama", "depth": 22, "year": "1995", "synopsis": "In 1990, novelist Paul Auster was asked to contribute a Christmas story to the New York Times. The resulting piece, \"Auggie Wren\u2019s Christmas Story,\" forms the basis for his screenplay for SMOKE. Directed by Wayne Wang and set in a Brooklyn cigar store, Auster expanded the story to include four other characters whose lives intertwine with Auggie Wren\u2019s. As Auggie, the manager of the store that serves as a neighborhood meeting place, Harvey Keitel gives a restrained, mellow performance. The other characters, Paul (William Hurt), a blocked writer; Rashid (Harold Perrineau Jr.), a troubled youth; Ruby (Stockard Channing), Auggie\u2019s former lover; and Cyrus (Forest Whitaker), Rashid\u2019s long-lost father, form a web of relationships over a few summer days. Auster, who had previously adapted his novel THE MUSIC OF CHANCE into a taut script, here exhibits a loose, almost improvisational style as he lets his characters simply talk about their lives. Wang eschews the big, somewhat melodramatic style he used in THE JOY LUCK CLUB for relaxed, natural direction that allows the actors, who are all terrific, to project an everyday realism seldom seen in American movies. The actual Christmas story appears at the end in a beautiful black-and-white montage, accompanied by a bittersweet Tom Waits song.", "cast": "Harvey Keitel William Hurt Stockard Channing Forest Whitaker Harold Perrineau Jr. Ashley Judd Giancarlo Esposito Victor Argo Erica Gimpel Clarice Taylor Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Malik Yoba Mary Ward Jared Harris Stephen Gevedon Howie Rose", "url": "https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film391573.html", "download_timeout": 180.0, "duration": "112 min.", "director": "Wayne Wang", "download_latency": 3.036942958831787, "download_slot": "www.filmaffinity.com", "mark": "7.7", "country": "United States", "title": "Smoke"},

They go to the railway station where they board a train for Germany. When they are taken off the train because they do not have tickets they manage to give the police the slip and thus resume their journey. After a few hours of walking in the night they run into a family of traveling players led by a certain Orestes.

As luck will have it this time they meet a truck driver, a vulgar drunk, who gives them a lift but rapes Voula in the back of the truck. Again, the two desperately run off and are pursued by the police. Orestes, aware of the danger they are in, rushes to their rescue on his motorbike. For all three life is suddenly transformed into a dream, a dream which ends, however, where the motorbike does: at a port where the traveling players have gathered together to sell off their stage costumes. The company breaks up. Orestes, who is still with the children, goes to a place nearby to sell his motorbike. Voula catches a glimpse of Orestes going off with the young man who has bought his bike, their hands touching slightly. Feeling betrayed, Voula ni longer knows who she can depend on. Orestes sadly waves to the children from the distance. Voula and Alexander go to the station. Last train, last stop. A river in the distance marks the border.

Opting to fight, they call on their greatest military leader, Alexander Nevsky, who is still recuperating with his troops from defeating the Swedish army. The historic battle on the frozen surface of Lake Peipus, pitting the peasant army of Nevsky against the better-equipped German force, is one of the most impressive spectacles in film history, a visual symphony of mutual slaughter as powerful now as on the day of its release.

{"genre": "Adventure", "depth": 30, "year": "1935", "synopsis": "MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY is the classic tale of one of the most infamous adventures on the high seas. The story is based on the fictional accounts written by Charles Nortdhoff and James Norman Hall. English conscripts sailing for Tahiti buckle under the chastisements of cruel Captain William Bligh, savagely portrayed by Charles Laughton. Bligh's grotesque abuses of power, including a brutal flogging that results in the death of the sick old ship's doctor, finally inspire a mutiny on the return voyage, conducted under the leadership of fair-minded officer Fletcher Christian, played by the dashing and heroic Clark Gable. Following the mutiny, Bligh and a few cronies are set onto a small dinghy after the successful muntiy, at which point the real adventure begins--Bligh's 4,000-mile journey from Tahiti to the Dutch East Indies. A solid seagoing adventure epic with breathtaking location photography, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY offers an unparalleled nautical authenticity--the ship photographed and the costumes worn were exact replicas of the 18th-century originals.", "cast": "Charles Laughton Clark Gable Franchot Tone Herbert Mundin Eddie Quillan Dudley Digges Donald Crisp Henry Stephenson Francis Lister Spring Byington Movita Mamo Clark Byron Russell Percy Waram David Torrence John Harrington Douglas Walton Ian Wolfe DeWitt Jennings Ivan F.
