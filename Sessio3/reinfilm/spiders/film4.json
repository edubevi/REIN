He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune \u2014 and saved 1,100 people from likely death.", "download_slot": "www.filmaffinity.com", "mark": "8.7", "depth": 1, "country": "United States", "title": "Schindler's List ", "duration": "195 min.", "cast": "Liam Neeson Ben Kingsley Ralph Fiennes Caroline Goodall Jonathan Sagall Embeth Davidtz Norbert Weisser Martin S.

{"download_latency": 1.3622736930847168, "download_timeout": 180.0, "director": "Fritz Lang", "synopsis": "In Fritz Langs startling and exquisite film M, fear stalks the streets of Berlin in the form of a serial child murderer whose grisly accomplishments are so heinous even the criminal minds of the underworld want him dead. Filmed in post-Weimar Germany during the infancy of the Nazi state, this tale of moral depravity serves not just as an allegory for the need of justice for all, but as an ominous foreshadowing of the sort of societal hysteria that leads to cultural witch hunts. Originally titled \"M\u00f6rder Unter Uns\" (\"Murder Among Us\"), M was one of Peter Lorre's (CASABLANCA) first major film roles. Langs expressionistic eye plunges into the dark cityscape of Berlin, as he follows the killer whistling down the street, seducing small children with toys and candy, and eventually fleeing for his life. A city paralysed by fear, and a vast criminal underground network of blind beggars, thieves and murderers, as well as an unforgettable climax notable for its startling statement about the murderous nature which resides within human beings, are all rendered in Lang\u2019s painterly cinematography of sharp angles, dark corners and breakneck pacing.", "download_slot": "www.filmaffinity.com", "mark": "8.3", "depth": 2, "country": "Germany", "title": "M ", "duration": "111 min.", "cast": "Peter Lorre Otto Wernicke Gustav Gr\u00fcndgens Theo Lingen Theodor Loos Georg John Ellen Widman Inge Landgut", "genre": "Thriller Mystery", "year": "1931", "url": "https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film875960.html"},
